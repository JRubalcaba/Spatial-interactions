Null models in spatial ecology are generally generated by drawing xy coordinates from a Poisson distribution, 
which represents how points (individuals) 
distribute in the space in abscence of any ecological interaction 
(e.g. competition or facilitation). This approach, which has been demonstrated to be capable to 
detect ecological patterns 
in the distribution of a species, require to assume that individuals can overlap in the space. Here I generate a null model 
where 
individuals are represented as n hard disks with radius r instead of points. I generate a big number of spatial configurations 
by drawing the coordinates of 
the central point of each disk from a uniform distribution. Any posible spatial configuration is 
allowed, except when an overlap occurs. The procedure generates a 
spatial pattern, with areas of repulsion and attraction. 
That is, the null model generates repulsion and attraction areas with the only assumption that sessile 
individuals cannot overlap 
in the space, and therefore, in abscence of ecological interactions. This suggest that  the use of too simplistic null models can lead 
to 
interpret some random spatial patterns as a product of complex ecological processes. This is a well known procedure in Statistic 
Mechanics that can be solved analythicaly. 
Here, I propose a simple code in R to ilustrate the rationale numerically, with application 
to spatial ecology.
