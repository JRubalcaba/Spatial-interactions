Some null models in spatial ecology are derived by drawing xy coordinates from a statistical distribution, such as Poisson distribution,
which represents how points (individuals) are distributed in the space in abscence of any ecological interaction 
(e.g. competition or facilitation). This approach, which has been demonstrated to be capable to detect ecological patterns on organisms' distributions, requires assuming that individuals can overlap in the space. Here I generate a null model 
where individuals are represented as n hard disks with radius r instead of points. I generate a big number of spatial configurations 
by drawing the coordinates of the central point of each disk from a uniform distribution. Any posible spatial configuration is 
allowed, except those in which two or more hard disk overlap. The procedure generates a spatial pattern, with alternating areas of repulsion and attraction. That is, the null model generates repulsion and attraction areas with the only assumption that sessile individuals cannot overlap in the space, and therefore, in abscence of any ecological interactions. This suggest that  the use of too simplistic null models can lead to interpret some random spatial patterns as a product of complex ecological processes. This is a well known procedure in Statistical Mechanics that can be solved analytically. Here, I propose a simple code in R to ilustrate it numerically , with applications to spatial ecology.
