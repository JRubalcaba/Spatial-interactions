Some null models in spatial ecology are derived by drawing xy coordinates from a statistical distribution, such as the Poisson distribution, which represents how points (individuals) are distributed in space in abscence of any ecological interaction 
(e.g. competition or facilitation). This approach can detect ecological patterns on organisms' distributions assuming that individuals can overlap in the space. Here I generate a null model where individuals are represented as n hard disks with radius r instead of points. I generate a big number of spatial configurations by drawing the coordinates of the central point of each disk from a uniform distribution. Any posible spatial configuration is allowed, except those in which two or more hard disk overlap (following the "tabula rasa rule"). The procedure gives rise to a spatial pattern with both areas of repulsion and attraction, which represent entropic forces aggregating individuals in some spatial regions. Although these patterns are well-known in physics as mechanisms driving polymere formation, the idea that entropic forces can drive some spatial interactions such as attraction or repulsion between individuals has not yet been examined in ecology, as far as I know. Here I show a simple algorithm that produces such patterns.
