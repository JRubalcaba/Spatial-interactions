Most null models in spatial ecology compute the distribution of individuals (points) thoughout space drawing their spatial coordinates from statistical distributions. Deviations from these distributions, either because points are more aggregated or scattered than expeted by chance, are interpreted as the result of ecological interactions such as comptetition or facilitation. Here I generate a null model where individuals are represented as n hard disks with radius r, instead of one-dimensional points. I generate a big number of spatial configurations by drawing the coordinates of the center of each disk from a uniform distribution. Any posible spatial configuration is allowed, except those in which two or more hard disk overlap (following the "tabula rasa rule"). The procedure gives rise to a spatial pattern with both areas of repulsion and attraction, which represent entropic forces aggregating individuals in some spatial regions. Although the effects of entropic forces are well-known in physics as mechanisms driving polymere aggregation, the idea that entropic forces can drive spatial interactions such as attraction or repulsion between individuals has not yet been examined in ecology, as far as I know. Here I show a simple algorithm that produces such patterns.
